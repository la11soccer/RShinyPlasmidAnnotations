Instructions for connecting to Rstudio on EC2 instance.
On EC2 instance copy the public IPv4 address from the instance details tab. It will looks something like this: 54.242.163.208
Paste that IP address into the web and add the suffix :8787 to direct to the RStudio log in page on the instance (complete address will look like this 54.242.163.208:8787).
Once at the log in page use the log in credentials defined to log into RStudio and may begin working. 


Once the RShiny application is moved into the correct directories on the instance to be launched (see paper) visit and test the website by using the same IP address
from the instance (here ours was 54.242.163.208) with port 3838. It will look like this 54.242.163.208:3838.
